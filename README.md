I connected VS code to my shop database in that I created in MySQL Workbench. I created an engine. I setup a base class for all the table classes to inherit from. I created classes for User, product, and Order to create tables for them in my shop database. The User table has a primary id that iterates each time a new user is created as well as fields for name and email. I made sure that emails are unique. The Product table has an id, name, and price field. I made sure the price field was an integer. I set Users and Products to each have a one to many relationship with orders. The Order table has an id, user_id, product_id, and quantity field. The user_id and product_id fields are foreign keys to Users and Products. I made sure the Order table is setup to have many to one relationships with Users and Products. The instructions did not say whether to make any fields optional, so I made them all required. I created 2 users, 3 products, and 4 orders with different quantities. I wrote queries to retrieve all users, all products, and all orders. I made sure to explicitly show the user’s name, product name, and quantity after retrieving the orders. I wrote an update statement to update the Product with the id of 1's price from 1000 to 900. I added a 3rd user and then wrote a delete statement to delete that user.
